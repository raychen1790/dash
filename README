Visualization Choices
1. Line Chart – Missions Over Time
Why this visualization:
Line charts are very good at showing trends and patterns over continuous time periods. For space mission data spanning decades, this allows users to immediately identify any periods of increased space race activity like the space race or conversely any decline periods. They can also see any long term trends in space exploration over decades.

2. Horizontal Bar Chart – Top 10 Companies by Mission Count
Why this visualization:
Bar charts are good for comparing quantities across categories. Ranking companies by mission helps us see which companies are most active in the space field. This way, with the bar, we can most easily see who stands out.

3. Pie Chart – Mission Status Distribution
Why this visualization:
Pie charts show part-to-whole relationships. Here we can easily see the proportion of successes vs failures. Pie charts supply an immediate visual cue of what the majority is.
